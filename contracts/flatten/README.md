| Name                   | Type        | Description
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| _rewardsDistribution   | Address     | Reward distrubutor's address
| _rewardsToken          | Address     | Staking Token address, on KYL mainnet, this should be 0x67B6D479c7bB412C54e03dCA8E1Bc6740ce6b99C
| _stakingToken          | Address     | Reward Token address, on KYL mainnet, this should be 0x67B6D479c7bB412C54e03dCA8E1Bc6740ce6b99C
| _stakingPoolCapParam   | uint256     | Staking pool capacity, setting this to 1000000000000000000000000000 gives a 1 Billion limit.

# Privileges

## Owner

Those who deploy this contract becomes owner, owner have following privileges:

- Transfer owner to other people
- Set staking pool capacity
- Set rewards duration
- Set rewards distributor

## Reward Distributor

Reward distributor is initialized at deployment and can be reseted by owner afterwards, reward distributor have the privilege to set reward rate.

# Reward Calculation and Distribution

Reward duration is initialized to be 30 days in the contract. For example, 
you want to distribute 2592000000 KYL in this 30 days reward peroid, you first transfer
2592000000 KYL to staking pool's contract address, then invoke the contract's notifyRewardAmount
method with reward parameter setting to 2592000000000000000000000000.

After the  contract's notifyRewardAmount method is invoked, the pool reward will start working. In this case, the pool
will distribute 1000 KYL every second(2592000000 / (3600 * 24 * 30) == 1000), if there're 500 KYL staking, every staking KYL will get 2 KYL reward every second.

You have to invoke notifyRewardAmount method manually again after preivous reward duration ends.
